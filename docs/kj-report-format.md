- Key patterns (routes, hotspots, sectors, platforms)
- Trajectory – is this getting worse, moving online, going cross-border?

## Fixed Disclaimer (insert after Key Judgements)

> "This assessment is based on a combination of open-source research, input from subject-matter experts on the ground, accounts by those with lived experience, and data analysis."
